# **About Me**

## _My Interests_
Some of my hobbies include working out, listening to music, hanging out with friends, playing sports like basketball and soccer. My academic interests lie in **Computer Science** and learning how to make applications and solutions in the field that ultimately **_help others and solve problems_**. 

## _Websites I Reccomend_
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) - I find Youtube _very_ useful and interesting for learning **so many new things** and for a large source of entertainment. 
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) - I find Instagram very interesting as it allows for me to **connect** with all my friends and see/show what is going on in my life and other people's lives _quickly_ while also seeing a wide range of other content, mostly meant for **entertainment**.
